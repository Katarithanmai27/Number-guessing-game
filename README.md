# Number-guessing-game
User inputs the lower and upper bounds of the range.
The system generates a random integer within this range and stores it.
A while loop handles repetitive guessing:
If the guess is higher than the target, the user is prompted with "Try Again! You guessed too high".
If the guess is lower than the target, the user is prompted with "Try Again! You guessed too small".
If the user guesses correctly, they receive "Congratulations!".
If the user fails to guess within the minimum attempts, they get "Better Luck Next Time!".
